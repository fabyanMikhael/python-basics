        <h1>Python Basics</h1>

        <h2>how python files are ran 🏃</h2>
        <p>
            <q>"a [program is] series of coded software instructions to control the operation of a computer or other machine" - from google</q>
            <br><br>
            Python's way to run code is to simply read it line by line and run it (interpreted)
            <br>
            You can run a python file simply by running in the command line : <code>python [filename].py</code>
        </p>

        <h2>Variables 📦</h2>
        <p>
            To do most things in code we must be able to save/hold onto data so that we can use it later
            <br>
            With python we can do this by:<pre><code>variable name = value</code></pre> 
            in code: <pre><code>dozen = 12</code></pre>
            This creates a variable with the name of <span class="ibold">dozen</span>
            that has the value of <span class="ibold">12</span>
            <br>
            in the background this looks something like:
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="images/Variables/Dozen.png" width="350em">
            <br>
            The variable Dozen <span class="bold">points</span>  to an <span class="ibold"><a title="An Abstraction that represents the grouping of data and related functions">object</a></span> which represents the value <span class="ibold">12</span>,
            keep this in mind as it helps to clear up some confusing behavior that you will see later (hopefully idk i haven't thought this over)
        
            
            <h3>another example</h3>
            <pre>
                <code style="margin-bottom: -6%;">x = 10
y = 3.65
z = "hello"                </code>
            </pre>
        this will create three variables: x,  y, and z
        <br>
        <spa class="bold">x</spa> will have the value of <spa class="bold">10</spa> (points to a int object with value of 10)<br>
        <spa class="bold">y</spa> will have the value of <spa class="bold">3.65</spa> (points to a float object with value of 3.65)<br>
        <spa class="bold">z</spa> will have the value of the string <spa class="bold">"hello"</spa> (points to a string object with value of hello)<br>
        <br>
        variables can always be re-assigned. 
        Python does not allow you to make a variable <a title="unchanging over time or unable to be changed.">immutable</a>
        (Objects however can have immutable properties):
        <br>
        <pre>
            <code style="margin-bottom: -6%;">x = 52
x = 1.0
x = "can be changed to any type"               </code>
        </pre>
        There is no particular syntax to tell when a variable is declared, the first assignment is just where the variable is created
        The variable <spa class="bold">x</spa> here gets declared and assigned the value 52, which is then changed to 1.0 and finally re-assigned to a string. Python is dynamically typed and variables do not have to stick to a certain type throughout the code execution
        
        <h2>Python Types 🔍</h2>
        Each Object in python has a type which determines what it is and gives you a hint at what it represents
        <br>
        These types are defined by <a title="a template for creating objects">classes-</a> which are definitions that specify how an object should be built, what data it has and what it can do
        <br><br>
        The basic types in python are:
        
        <h3>int (integer) 🔢</h3>
        represents a whole number (negatives and positives). In newer python versions this type has no limit, you can set it to a number that is as high as you want
        
        <h3>float (float-point number) #️⃣</h3>
        represents a decimal number (negatives and positives). These have limited precision and can sometimes have unexpected behavior
        
        <h3>str (String) 🏷️</h3>
        represents a piece of text (a collection of 0, 1 or more characters)

        <h3>bool (boolean) 🔄</h3>
        can be only be either <span class="ibold">True</span> or <span class="ibold">False</span>
        
        <h3>None ❓</h3>
        This type can only be <span class="ibold">None</span>. It is used to show that there is nothing there
        (for example, assigning <span class="bold">None</span> to a variable means it currently has no value)
