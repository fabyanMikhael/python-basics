        <h1>Python Basics</h1>

        <h2>how python files are ran 🏃</h2>
        <p>
            <q>"a [program is] series of coded software instructions to control the operation of a computer or other machine" - from google</q>
            <br><br>
            Python's way to run code is to simply read it line by line and run it (interpreted)
            <br>
            You can run a python file simply by running in the command line : <code>python [filename].py</code>
        </p>

        <h2  class="push_up">Variables 📦</h2>
        <p>
            To do most things in code we must be able to save/hold onto data so that we can use it later
            <br>
            With python we can do this by:<pre><code>variable name = value</code></pre> 
            in code: <pre><code>dozen = 12</code></pre>
            This creates a variable with the name of <span class="ibold">dozen</span>
            that has the value of <span class="ibold">12</span>
            <br>
            in the background this looks something like:
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="images/Variables/Dozen.png" width="350em">
            <br>
            The variable Dozen <span class="bold">points</span>  to an <span class="ibold"><a title="An Abstraction that represents the grouping of data and related functions">object</a></span> which represents the value <span class="ibold">12</span>,
            keep this in mind as it helps to clear up some confusing behavior that you will see later (hopefully idk i haven't thought this over)
        
            
            <h3>another example</h3>
            <pre>
                <code style="margin-bottom: -6%;">x = 10
y = 3.65
z = "hello"                </code>
            </pre>
        this will create three variables: x,  y, and z
        <br>
        <spa class="bold">x</spa> will have the value of <spa class="bold">10</spa> (points to a int object with value of 10)<br>
        <spa class="bold">y</spa> will have the value of <spa class="bold">3.65</spa> (points to a float object with value of 3.65)<br>
        <spa class="bold">z</spa> will have the value of the string <spa class="bold">"hello"</spa> (points to a string object with value of hello)<br>
        <br>
        variables can always be re-assigned
        <br>
        Python does not allow you to make a variable <a title="unchanging over time or unable to be changed.">immutable</a>
        (Objects however can have immutable properties):
        <br>
        <pre>
            <code style="margin-bottom: -6%;">x = 52
x = 1.0
x = "can be changed to any type"               </code>
        </pre>
        There is no particular syntax to tell when a variable is declared, the first assignment is just where the variable is created
        <br>
        The variable <spa class="bold">x</spa> here gets declared and assigned the value 52, which is then changed to 1.0 and finally re-assigned to a string
        <br>
        Python is dynamically typed and variables do not have to stick to a certain type throughout the code execution
        
        <h2  class="push_up">Python's Primitive Types 🔍</h2>
        Each Object in python has a type which determines what it is and gives you a hint at what it represents
        <br>
        These types are defined by <a title="a template for creating objects">classes-</a> which are definitions that specify how an object should be built, what data it has and what it can do
        <br>
        one thing I should note that is I have used a new syntax for declaring variables,
        <br>
        this syntax allows you to explicitly set the type of the variable 
        <br>
        here's the format:
        <pre><code>[variable name]: [type] = [value]</code></pre>
        <br>
        <br>
        note however that this does not enforce the variable to hold only that type,
        it is just for reading and autocompletion purposes
        <br>
        The basic types in python are:
        
        <h3 class="push_up_l">int (Integer) 🔢</h3>
        represents a whole number.
        <br> In newer python versions this type has no limit, you can set it to a number that is as high as you want
        <br>(-) negative and (+) positive
        <pre><code>x: int = 5</code></pre>

        <h3 class="push_up_l">float (Float-point number) #️⃣</h3>
        represents a decimal number <br>(-) negative and (+) positive
        <pre><code>x: float = 2.7</code></pre>

        <h3 class="push_up_l">str (String) 🏷️</h3>
        represents a piece of text (a collection of 0, 1 or more characters)
        <pre><code>x: str = "this is a string"</code></pre>
        single quotes also work
        <pre><code>x: str = 'hello there!'</code></pre>
        <h3>bool (Boolean) 🔄</h3>
        can be only be either <span class="ibold">True</span> or <span class="ibold">False</span>
        <pre><code>x: bool = False</code></pre>

        <h3 class="push_up_l">None ❓</h3>
        This type can only be <span class="ibold">None</span>. It is used to show that there is nothing there
        (for example, assigning <span class="bold">None</span> to a variable means it currently has no value)
        <pre><code>x: None = None </code></pre>

        <h2  class="push_up">Python's Collection Types 🧮</h2>
        <h3 class="push_up_l">list 📗</h3>
        A collection type that can hold many objects (useful for holding hundreds or thousands of objects instead of making a variable for each)
        
        <br>
        You can make one with the  <code>[a,b,c,...]</code> syntax
        <pre><code>x: list = [1,10,23] </code></pre>
        You can also have any type you want in it
        <pre><code>x: list = [4.325, 7, "hello"] </code></pre>
        Retrieving an element from the list is done with the index syntax: <code>array[index]</code>
        <pre><code>x: list = [4.325, 7, "hello"] 
num : float = x[0]
num2: int   = x[1]
hi  : str   = x[2]
print(x)    #prints 4.325
print(num2) #prints 7
print(hi)   #prints hello</code></pre>
        note that the indices for lists start at 0, so the first element is actually at the 0th index not 1
        <br>
        ALSO the types (the <code>: float</code> part of <code>x: float</code>) I am writing are unneccessary but you should write them to get used to it
        (also helps with code completion)
        <br>
        <h3 class="push_up_l">Dictionary 📒</h3>
        maps primitive or hashable objects to values of any type
        <br>
        you can create a dictionary with the <code>{key: value,...}</code> constructor
        <Pre><code>dictionary: dict = {'key': 'value', 3: 'three'}</code></Pre>
        This now means that in the dictionary: <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">input --> output</span><br>
        'key' --> 'value' <br>
        3     --> 'three' <br>
        <br></span>
        retrieving an element from the dictionary is done by using an existing key with this syntax: <code>dictionary[key]</code>
        <pre><code>dictionary: dict = {'key': 'value', 3: 'three'}
key_item = dictionary['key'] #will be the string 'value'
three = dictionary[3] #will be the string 'three'        </code></pre>
        adding and setting a value of a key is done in the same way: <code>dictionary[key] = new_value</code>
        <pre><code>dictionary = {}
dictionary['new val'] = 145.25
dictionary['new val'] = 'changing the value'
        </code></pre>
        finally, deleting a key/value pair can be done with: 
        <code>del dictionary[key]</code>
        <pre><code>dictionary = {}
dictionary['delete me'] = ["you can nest lists", "and", "dictionaries"]
del dictionary['delete me'] # 'delete me' is now gone
print(dictionary['delete me']) # this will cause an error</code></pre>
